SQLite ORM for Android.

This project was created to easily manipulate Android SQLite database.

At that time, all SQLite requests had to be **manually** written (`SELECT * FROM blablabla`). Eventually, Google released [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) which, not only performs faster, but also actively maintained.
